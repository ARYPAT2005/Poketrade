Poketrade
=========

Description
-----------
PokéTrade is a full-stack web application built by a team of four developers as part of a collaborative software engineering project. The platform allows users to collect, manage, and trade Pokémon cards in a dynamic and interactive environment.

Our team followed Agile development methodologies, incorporating Scrum practices such as weekly sprint planning, stand-ups, and retrospectives with a real world client. This approach enabled us to iterate quickly, adapt to feedback, and maintain clear communication throughout the development cycle.
